Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is mainly about AI helping you to become a better runner. Just you and your own skills and weaknesses will be analyzed by AI, and AI will calculate better progress and work that is compatible with you. Not everyone else. Because everybody is different, and that is why you have to personalize your work. This will empower runners to reach their full potential. 


## Background

* Better understanding. 
Many running programs offer an overall plan designed to accommodate most individuals based on their duration and pace. However, numerous factors beyond one's running history can affect progress, rendering the plan unsuitable for many runners. By utilizing AI, you can gain a better understanding of how your body works and why some days feel better or worse, even when running in the same environment and pace as usual.
* No progress.
It's important to feel that you're making progress in running to maintain motivation and enjoyment. It doesn't have to mean becoming an elite runner, but rather feeling that you have more endurance and can tackle distances you didn't think possible before. It's about increasing your confidence.
* Injuries.
Injuries or illnesses can interrupt training, and one needs to rest for a while. Often, it's difficult to know when to resume and increase training again to avoid setbacks. This is where AI can help.



## How is it used?

By allowing AI to analyze your health, including data from other training apps, heart rate monitors, health apps, weather apps and for women, menstrual cycles, AI can provide a current health status and calculate the starting point for your running. This can then result in a calculated route and suitable speed based on your current condition. Additionally, it notifies when it's time to rest. Even with injuries requiring specific terrain for running, AI can calculate the route and suitable hills for hill training. This is an idea for runners who want to delve deep into harmonizing running with their body.

## Challenges

Balancing weather and surface conditions can be challenging as they can vary greatly with weather patterns. For example, the ground may be icy even though the weather report indicates it's not so cold. Running on slippery surfaces, as well as in rainy or muddy conditions, can have an impact. So, weather can pose a challenge.

## What next?

One could also incorporate food apps, or suitable meals based on personal food preferences, which AI can then calculate appropriate dishes that are both nutritious and delicious. These meals could be tailored to aid recovery after running or at other times. This is because meals also have a significant influence on training and how well the body copes with it. So that one can enjoy running and stimulate the release of endorphins in the body
